# Create a new LaTeX header file for doxygen PDF docs
#
# Note: this LaTeX file depends on Doxygen and LaTeX versions, resp.
# and needs therefore to be created with current Doxygen and LaTeX
# versions on the build system.
#
# Usage:
#
#   $ sh make_header doxygen_path input-file output-file
#
# where
# - 'doxygen_path' is the full path to the doxygen executable
#   or just 'doxygen'. If the full path is used an arbitrary
#   doxygen executable and thus doxygen version can be used.
# - 'input-file' is the pure (LaTeX) title page (template)
# - 'output-file' is the generated (LaTeX) title page (template)
#   that is used by `make' or `cmake` to generate the final LaTeX
#   page header (combined doxygen template + FLTK title page).
#
